# Building and analyzing enhancer-driven TF-gene regulatory networks
Updated on 2021-02-01

## Introduction
These scripts were used to build TF-gene regulatory network from maize enhancers from Oka et al., Genome Biology, 2018.

The steps 1-4 are applicable to any datasets. The steps 5-8 have been
tailored to analyse husk vs. V2-IST networks. To apply it to your
dataset, you will need to modify the scripts.

To run this pipeline:
..* install all required softwares and packages (see
**List of required softwares and packages** below).
..* Create a main folder (eg.: ~/Documents/Networks/) to work from
..* Place in a folder (eg.: ~/Documents/Networks/) the files listed in
**List of Files:**.



### List of Files:
⋅⋅* genome.fasta : FASTA file containing the genome sequence
..* genes.gff3 : GFF3 file containing genes annotation in the genome
..* GeneOntologyAnnotation.txt : TXT file with Gene Ontology annotation of the genes
..* TransposableElements.gff : GFF file with transposable elements annotation for the genome
..* TransposableElementsAnnotation.txt:  tab-separated TXT file containing transposable elements annotations, including 3 columns: TE name (TE), superfamily (Superfamily), and family (consensus)
..* enhancers.bed : BED file containing the enhancers coordinates (chr, start, end), the enhancer name (name) and an optional column corresponding to tissue (here "HUSK", "V2-IST or "Both") that is necessary for step 7.
..* motifs.meme : MEME file containing the transcription factor binding sites motifs
..* expr\_raw.txt : tab-separated TXT file containing raw expression counts (genes in row and samples in columns)

## Step 1 -Map Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) to enhancers
To obtain enhancer sequences and map TFBS, run:

```
$ cd ~/Documents/Networks/
$ bedtools  getfasta -fo genome.fasta  -fi enhancers.fasta -bed enhancers.bed
$ fimo --o FIMO/ motifs.meme enhancers.fasta 1>FIMO/fimo.out 2>FIMO/fimo.err
```

## Step 2 - Normalize gene expression with YARN and plot principal component analyses results.
To normalize expression data and plot results for PC1 and PC2, run:
```
Rscript normalize_expression_data.R ./ 3
```
This R script takes 2 arguments as input:
..* the path to the folder containing data
..* the threshold for gene expression filtering. A gene is considered expressed if it has a raw counts >0 in at least *threshold* number of samples.

Results will be stored in the main folder and PCA will be plotted in Figures/

## Step 3 - Build prior from TFBS results, enhancers and gene coordinates and map Transposable elements.
To build a prior network that include all possible regulatory
relationships between TFBS within enhancers and candidate target
genes, run:
```
Rscript build_prior.R ./ 250000 0.01
```
This R script takes 3 arguments as input:
..* the path to the folder containing data.
..* the size of the window to search for potential target genes.
..* the qvalue threshold to filter TFBS results. Only TFBS with a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value (q-value in FIMO results) under this threshold will be kept.

To build an annotation table with enhancer, TFBS, all candidate target
genes, and Transposable elements overlapping TE, run:
```
Rscript make_enhancers_tfbs_gene_te_table.R ./ 250000 0.01
```
This R script takes 3 arguments as input:
..* the path to the folder containing data.
..* the size of the window to search for potential target genes.
..* the qvalue threshold to filter TFBS results. Only TFBS with a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value (q-value in FIMO results) under this threshold will be kept.

## Step 4 - Build networks from prior using PANDA/LIONESS.
```
ln -s expr.txt Network/expr.txt
cd Networks/
python run_panda.py -e ./expr.txt -m ./priors.txt -o output_panda.txt -q output_lioness.txt
cd ../
Rscript concat_lioness_results.R ./ 
```
The PANDA/LIONESS software takes 2 arguments as input:
..* path to the file with expression data
..* path to the file with network prior

The R scripts take 1 argument as input:
..* path to the main folder

Results will be stored in the Network/ folder

## Step 5 - PANDA/LIONESS networks: differential targeting analysis.
To obtain the list of differentially targeted edges between two
tissues (here Husk and V2-IST), run:
```
Rscript differential_targeting.R ./ 0.01 GeneOntologyAnnotation.txt
```
This R script takes 3 arguments in input:
..* the path to the main folder,
..* the Benjamini-Hocheberg corrected p-value threshold for differential targeting analysis
..* The name of the file containing the Gene Ontology annotations for
all genes.

## Step 6 - PANDA/LIONESS networks: tissue-specific module identification 
To identify the modules in each tissue-specific network and analyse
gene content of tissue-specific and shared modules, run:
``` 
Rscript modules_network_lioness.R ./ 100 GeneOntologyAnnotation.txt
```

This R script takes 3 arguments in input:
..* the path to the main folder,
..* the number of top genes to retain in each module for the Gene
Ontology enrichment analysis
..* The name of the file containing the Gene Ontology annotations for
all genes.

## Step 7 - Identification of each enhancer top target

To identify enhancers most likely target genes, run:
``` 
Rscript find_enhancer_topgenes_pairs.R ./
```

This R script takes 1 argument in input:
..* the path to the main folder.


## Step 8 - TE superfamilies and families enrichment analysis
To perform transposable elements superfamilies and families enrichment
analyses in enhancer and TFBS sequences in a tissue-specific function,
and obtain Gene Ontlogy enrichment analysis for candidate target genes, run:
``` 
Rscript cross_enhancers_genes_tfbs_TE.R ./
```

This R script takes 1 argument in input:
..* the path to the main folder.
